/**
 * WeWrite Activity Diff Standardization - Enhanced Text Diff Generator
 *
 * Generates a detailed text diff between two content strings with enhanced preview
 * that provides context around changes, showing both additions and deletions.
 *
 * This function is part of the comprehensive diff standardization system that ensures
 * consistent diff display across all ActivityCard implementations in WeWrite.
 *
 * Enhanced Diff Algorithm Features:
 * - Provides up to 3 lines of context (120 characters â‰ˆ 3 lines)
 * - Accurately calculates character-level diffs using Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
 * - Returns structured diff data with beforeContext, addedText, removedText, afterContext
 * - Handles edge cases like empty content, minimal changes, and parsing errors
 *
 * Integration with Standardized Components:
 * - Used by DiffPreview component for consistent visual display
 * - Used by DiffStats component for accurate statistics
 * - Integrated with all ActivityCard implementations across the application
 *
 * Diff Algorithm Implementation:
 * - Uses Myers' algorithm (simplified) for character-level diff calculation
 * - Tracks additions and deletions separately with detailed operations
 * - Provides context around changes for better user understanding
 * - Optimized for performance with large text content
 *
