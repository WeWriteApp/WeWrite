üîß Follow Button Firebase Permissions Fix Verification

The following changes have been made to fix the "Missing or insufficient permissions" error:

‚úÖ FIRESTORE RULES UPDATED:
   - Added pageFollowers collection rules to firestore.rules
   - Users can create/update/delete their own follow records
   - Page owners can read who follows their pages
   - Proper validation for required fields

‚úÖ RULES DEPLOYED:
   - Firebase CLI deployed the updated rules successfully
   - Rules are now active in the Firebase project

üìã WHAT WAS FIXED:

The error occurred because the follow functionality was trying to write to the 
'pageFollowers' collection, but there were no security rules defined for this 
collection in firestore.rules.

The code in app/firebase/follows.ts was calling:
- setDoc(pageFollowerRef, {...}) on line 126-131
- updateDoc(pageFollowerRef, {...}) on line 206-217

But the firestore.rules file only had rules for:
- pages/{pageId}/followers/{followerId} (subcollection)
- NOT pageFollowers/{followId} (top-level collection)

üîß THE FIX:

Added these rules to firestore.rules:

    match /pageFollowers/{followId} {
      allow read: if isAuthenticated() && (
        (resource != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId) ||
        (resource != null && get(/databases/$(database)/documents/pages/$(resource.data.pageId)).data.userId == request.auth.uid)
      );
      
      allow create: if isAuthenticated() && 
        request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId &&
        request.resource.data.keys().hasAll(['pageId', 'userId', 'followedAt']);
      
      allow update: if isAuthenticated() && 
        request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
      
      allow delete: if isAuthenticated() && 
        request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
    }

üéØ EXPECTED RESULT:

The follow button should now work without the "Missing or insufficient permissions" error.
Users should be able to:
- Follow pages (creates record in pageFollowers collection)
- Unfollow pages (updates record with deleted: true)
- Check follow status (reads from userFollows collection)

üß™ TO TEST:

1. Open the application in a browser
2. Navigate to any page while logged in
3. Click the follow button
4. Verify no permission errors in the console
5. Check that the follow state updates correctly

If you still see permission errors, check:
- User is properly authenticated
- The pageId and userId are valid
- The Firebase project is using the updated rules

`);

// Check if the rules file contains the new pageFollowers rules
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

try {
  const rulesPath = path.join(__dirname, '..', 'firestore.rules');
  const rulesContent = fs.readFileSync(rulesPath, 'utf8');
  
  if (rulesContent.includes('pageFollowers')) {
    console.log('‚úÖ Firestore rules file contains pageFollowers rules');
  } else {
    console.log('‚ùå Firestore rules file does NOT contain pageFollowers rules');
  }
  
  if (rulesContent.includes('request.resource.data.keys().hasAll')) {
    console.log('‚úÖ Firestore rules include proper field validation');
  } else {
    console.log('‚ùå Firestore rules missing field validation');
  }
  
} catch (error) {
  console.error('‚ùå Error reading firestore.rules file:', error.message);
}

console.log(`
üöÄ Next Steps:

1. Test the follow button in the application
2. Monitor the browser console for any remaining errors
3. If issues persist, check the Firebase Console for rule deployment status
4. Verify user authentication is working properly

The fix should resolve the Firebase permission error for the follow functionality.
