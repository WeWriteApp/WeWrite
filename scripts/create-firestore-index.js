FIRESTORE INDEX CREATION INSTRUCTIONS
=======================================================================

You need to create a composite index for the following query:
- Collection: pages
- Filter: isPublic == true
- Order by: lastModified (descending)

Please visit the following URL to create this index:
https://console.firebase.google.com/v1/r/project/wewrite-ccd82/firestore/indexes?create_composite=Cktwcm9qZWN0cy93ZXdyaXRlLWNjZDgyL2RhdGFiYXNlcy8oZGVmYXVsdCkvY29sbGVjdGlvbkdyb3Vwcy9wYWdlcy9pbmRleGVzL18QARoMCghpc1B1YmxpYxABGhAKDGxhc3RNb2RpZmllZBACGgwKCF9fbmFtZV9fEAI

Steps to create the index:
1. Visit the URL above
2. You'll be taken to the Firebase console with the index configuration pre-filled
3. Click "Create index" to confirm
4. Wait for the index to be created (this may take a few minutes)

Once the index is created, the Recent Activity feature will work properly.

Note: You only need to create this index once. After creation, all queries
that filter by isPublic and order by lastModified will use this index.
