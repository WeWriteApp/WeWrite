🔧 Firebase Authentication Test

This script will help us understand if the new session management system
is properly maintaining Firebase authentication for Firestore operations.

The issue we're investigating:
- Session management shows user as authenticated
- But Firebase Auth might not be properly synchronized
- Causing Firestore security rules to deny access

Let's check what's happening...

// Instructions for manual testing
console.log(`
📋 MANUAL TESTING STEPS:

1. 🔍 Check Follow Button (KNOWN ISSUE):
   - Navigate to any page you don't own
   - Try to click the follow button
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Expected: "permission-denied" error

2. 💾 Test Save Functionality:
   - Go to /new to create a new page
   - Add a title and some content
   - Try to save the page
   - Check if it saves successfully or shows permission errors

3. 🗑️ Test Delete Functionality:
   - Go to one of your own pages
   - Try to delete the page
   - Check if it works or shows permission errors

4. ✏️ Test Edit Functionality:
   - Go to one of your own pages
   - Click edit and make changes
   - Try to save the changes
   - Check if it works or shows permission errors

5. 🔍 Check Browser Console:
   - Look for Firebase auth state debug messages
   - Look for any "permission-denied" errors
   - Look for session vs Firebase auth mismatches

🎯 WHAT TO LOOK FOR:

✅ If ONLY follow button fails:
   - Issue is specific to follow functionality
   - Other Firebase operations work fine
   - Problem is likely in follow-specific rules or logic

❌ If MULTIPLE operations fail:
   - Issue is with Firebase auth synchronization
   - Session management not properly maintaining Firebase auth
   - Need to fix the auth bridge between session and Firebase

📊 EXPECTED RESULTS:

Based on the code analysis, the new session management system has:
- SessionAuthInitializer that bridges Firebase auth and sessions
- Fallback logic in save operations for when Firebase auth isn't ready
- Session-based authentication as backup

If save/edit/delete work but follow doesn't, the issue is specific to 
the follow functionality and not a general auth problem.

Please test these operations and report back which ones work/fail!

console.log(`
🚀 Ready for testing!

Please test the operations above and let me know the results.
This will help us determine if this is a general Firebase auth issue
or specific to the follow functionality.
