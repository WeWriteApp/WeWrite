## Consistency Across Application

### Areas with Soft Delete Filtering ‚úÖ
1. **Search Results** - All search APIs filter deleted pages
2. **Trending Pages** - Trending algorithms exclude deleted pages
3. **Random Pages** - Random page discovery excludes deleted pages
4. **User Profile Pages** - User "Pages" tabs exclude deleted pages
5. **Related Pages** - Page recommendations exclude deleted pages
6. **Group Pages** - Group page listings exclude deleted pages
7. **Recent Activity** - Activity feeds exclude deleted pages
8. **Page Discovery** - All discovery mechanisms exclude deleted pages

### Recovery Interface ‚úÖ
- **Location**: User Settings ‚Üí Recently Deleted Pages

## Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Automatic permanent deletion after 30 days
- Comprehensive filtering across all user-facing surfaces
- Search API filtering (all variants)
- Page discovery feature filtering
- User profile page filtering
- Database query helper functions
- Type definitions updated
- Recovery interface (already existed)
- **Individual page access API filtering** - `/api/pages/[id]/route.js` now checks for soft-deleted pages
- **Page view component filtering** - Both `app/[id]/page.js` and `app/[id]/edit/page.js` now check for soft-deleted pages
- **Firestore indexes updated** - Added `deleted` field to all relevant indexes for optimal performance

### üìù Notes
- BigQuery schema should be updated to include `deleted` field for optimal performance
- All Firestore queries now consistently exclude soft-deleted pages

- **CRITICAL GAPS FIXED**: Soft-deleted pages are now properly hidden from direct URL access and API endpoints

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test soft delete functionality in user interface
2. Verify deleted pages don't appear in search results
3. Confirm deleted pages don't appear in trending/random sections
4. Test recovery interface in user settings
5. Verify automatic cleanup after 30 days (can be tested with shorter timeframe)
