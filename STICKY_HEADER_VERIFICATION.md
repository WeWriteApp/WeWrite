# Sticky Header Verification Checklist

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Component Standardization
- [x] Unified SectionTitle component at `/components/ui/section-title.tsx`
- [x] Added backward compatibility with `rightContent` prop
- [x] Updated all imports across the application:
  - [x] `ActivitySectionHeader.js`
  - [x] `page.js` (main homepage)
  - [x] `ActivitySection.js`
  - [x] `RandomPagesOptimized.tsx`
  - [x] `HomeGroupsSection.tsx`
- [x] Removed duplicate component `/components/SectionTitle.tsx`

### 2. Sticky Positioning Bug Fix
- [x] Simplified sticky logic in `StickySection.tsx`
- [x] Fixed headers returning to original position when scrolling up
- [x] Improved section transition handling
- [x] Added clear debug logging for development

### 3. Recent Activity Section Cleanup
- [x] Fixed duplicate filter button issue in `ActivitySection.js`
- [x] Corrected prop logic: `renderFilterInHeader={true}` prevents component filter
- [x] Confirmed proper separation of concerns:
  - Filter rendered in `ActivitySectionHeader` for sticky header
  - `RecentActivity` does NOT render its own filter when `renderFilterInHeader={true}`

### 4. Table/Card Styling Standardization
- [x] Unified border radius to `rounded-2xl` across all components
- [x] Standardized border class to `border-theme-medium`
- [x] Fixed styling in `TrendingPages.tsx`
- [x] Fixed styling in `TopUsers.js`
- [x] Fixed styling in `HomeGroupsSection.tsx`
- [x] Removed padding inconsistencies

### 5. Build & Deployment
- [x] Application builds successfully with no errors
- [x] No TypeScript compilation issues
- [x] No linting errors
- [x] All imports resolved correctly

## üß™ Manual Testing Required

Please verify the following functionality in the browser:

### Sticky Header Behavior
- [ ] **Scroll Down**: Headers stick to top when scrolling past their original position
- [ ] **Scroll Up**: Headers return to original position when scrolling back up
- [ ] **Section Transitions**: Only one header is sticky at a time
- [ ] **Smooth Transitions**: No jarring movements between sections

### Recent Activity Filter
- [ ] **Filter Dropdown**: Works correctly in sticky header
- [ ] **No Duplicates**: Only one filter button visible (fixed duplicate issue)
- [ ] **State Persistence**: Filter selection persists during scrolling
- [ ] **Functionality**: "All" and "Following" modes work correctly

### Table/Card Styling Consistency
- [ ] **Unified Borders**: All tables/cards use `rounded-2xl` corners
- [ ] **Consistent Border Colors**: All use `border-theme-medium`
- [ ] **Uniform Styling**: Consistent shadows, backgrounds, hover effects
- [ ] **No Style Conflicts**: No mixed styling approaches

### Responsive Design
- [ ] **Mobile**: Headers work correctly on mobile devices
- [ ] **Desktop**: Headers work correctly on desktop
- [ ] **Shuffle Button**: Shows text on desktop, icon-only on mobile
- [ ] **Consistent Styling**: All headers have uniform appearance

### Interactive Elements
- [ ] **Click Behavior**: Headers scroll to section top or page top
- [ ] **Button Functionality**: All buttons in headers work correctly
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Tab navigation works properly
- [ ] **Account Switcher**: Remains accessible with proper z-index

### Performance
- [ ] **Smooth Scrolling**: No performance issues during scroll
- [ ] **Memory Usage**: No memory leaks from scroll handlers
- [ ] **Responsive**: Quick response to scroll events

## üêõ Known Issues to Watch For

1. **Z-Index Conflicts**: Ensure account switcher and other overlays work
2. **Mobile Safari**: Test sticky behavior on iOS Safari specifically
3. **Performance**: Monitor for any scroll lag on slower devices
4. **Edge Cases**: Test rapid scrolling and section boundaries

## üîß Debugging Tools

If issues are found, check:
- Browser console for `[StickySection]` debug logs
- Element inspector for CSS classes (`section-header-sticky`)
- Network tab for any failed requests
- Performance tab for scroll performance

## üìù Success Criteria

All tasks are complete when:
- ‚úÖ All sticky headers work as expected
- ‚úÖ No duplicate components or functionality
- ‚úÖ Consistent styling across all sections
- ‚úÖ Proper responsive behavior
- ‚úÖ No console errors or warnings
- ‚úÖ Smooth user experience

## üöÄ Next Steps

After verification:
1. Test on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
2. Test on multiple devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)
3. Consider user feedback on the new behavior
4. Monitor for any performance regressions
5. Update documentation if needed
