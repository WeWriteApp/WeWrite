# Firebase Security Rules Audit & Fix

## 🚨 Critical Security Issues Found & Fixed

### Before (INSECURE):
- **Firestore**: Default rule allowing unrestricted read/write access to ALL documents
- **Realtime DB**: Default rule allowing unrestricted read/write access to ENTIRE database
- **Missing authentication checks** for sensitive data
- **Overly permissive rules** for user profiles and private data

### After (SECURE):
- ✅ **Removed all dangerous default rules**
- ✅ **Implemented authentication requirements** for all operations
- ✅ **Added proper authorization checks** based on ownership and membership
- ✅ **Applied principle of least privilege** throughout

## 📋 Security Fixes Summary

### Firestore Rules (`firestore.rules`)

#### 🔒 **Pages Collection**
- **Before**: Unrestricted access via default rule
- **After**: 
  - Owners can always read/write their pages
  - Public pages readable by authenticated users
  - Group pages follow group membership rules
  - Private pages only accessible to owners
  - Data validation on create/update operations

#### 🔒 **User Profiles (`/users/{userId}`)**
- **Before**: Readable by anyone (privacy risk)
- **After**: 
  - Only authenticated users can read profiles
  - Users can only write to their own profiles
  - UID immutability enforced

#### 🔒 **Groups Collection**
- **Before**: No explicit rules (fell back to dangerous default)
- **After**:
  - Public groups readable by authenticated users
  - Private groups only accessible to members
  - Only group owners/admins can modify settings
  - Member management with role-based permissions

#### 🔒 **Admin & System Collections**
- **Feature Flags**: Admin-only write access
- **Admin Users**: Super restricted access
- **Counters**: Read-only for users, write for system/owners
- **Notifications**: User-specific access only
- **Subscriptions**: Owner-only access to financial data

#### 🔒 **Privacy-Sensitive Data**
- **Username History**: Owner/admin access only
- **User Activity**: Owner/admin access only
- **Page Views**: Authenticated read, controlled write
- **Follower Data**: User-specific access

### Realtime Database Rules (`database.rules.json`)

#### 🔒 **User Profiles (`/users/{uid}`)**
- **Before**: Readable by anyone
- **After**: Authentication required for all access

#### 🔒 **Groups (`/groups/{groupId}`)**
- **Before**: Some authentication, but inconsistent
- **After**: 
  - Authentication required for all operations
  - Public/private group access properly enforced
  - Member management with role-based permissions

#### 🔒 **Admin & System Data**
- **Config**: Admin-only access
- **Admin Users**: Super restricted
- **User Activity**: User-specific access
- **Notifications**: User-specific access

#### 🔒 **Removed Dangerous Default Rule**
- **Before**: `"$other": { ".read": true, ".write": true }`
- **After**: No default rule - explicit deny for undefined paths

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. **Authentication First**
```javascript
function isAuthenticated() {
  return request.auth != null;
}
```

### 2. **Ownership Validation**
```javascript
function isOwner(userId) {
  return request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
}
```

### 3. **Admin Access Control**
```javascript
function isAdmin() {
  return request.auth != null && (
    request.auth.token.email == 'jamiegray2234@gmail.com' ||
    exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/adminUsers/$(request.auth.uid))
  );
}
```

### 4. **Data Validation**
- Required fields validation on document creation
- Immutable field protection (e.g., userId, uid)
- Type checking for critical fields

### 5. **Principle of Least Privilege**
- No default allow-all rules
- Explicit permissions for each collection
- Role-based access for group operations

## 🔍 Application Functionality Preserved

### ✅ **TopUsers Component**
- Can still read public page counts via counters collection
- Authentication required but functionality maintained

### ✅ **User Profile Pages**
- Public profile data accessible to authenticated users
- Private data only visible to owners
- Page counts work correctly with new counter rules

### ✅ **Group Functionality**
- Public groups discoverable by authenticated users
- Private groups accessible only to members
- Member management preserved with proper authorization

### ✅ **Page Management**
- Create, edit, delete workflows preserved
- Visibility controls properly enforced
- Group page access follows membership rules

### ✅ **Search & Discovery**
- Public content searchable by authenticated users
- Private content properly filtered
- Group content follows membership rules

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### 1. **Deploy Firestore Rules**
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### 2. **Deploy Realtime Database Rules**
```bash
firebase deploy --only database
```

### 3. **Verify Deployment**
- Check Firebase Console for rule deployment status
- Test key user flows to ensure functionality
- Monitor for any authentication errors

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes & Migration

### **Authentication Now Required**
- All database operations now require user authentication
- Anonymous users can no longer access any data
- Applications must ensure users are signed in before data access

### **No More Public Read Access**
- Public pages still accessible but require authentication
- Search functionality requires user login
- TopUsers component requires authentication

### **Admin Operations**
- Feature flag management restricted to admins
- User management operations require admin privileges
- Analytics data access restricted

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### **Test Authentication Flows**
1. Verify signed-in users can access appropriate data
2. Confirm signed-out users are properly denied
3. Test admin-only operations with admin accounts

### **Test Authorization**
1. Users can only access their own private data
2. Group members can access group content
3. Public content accessible to all authenticated users

### **Test Data Integrity**
1. Users cannot modify others' data
2. Immutable fields cannot be changed
3. Required fields are enforced on creation

## 📊 Security Monitoring

### **Monitor for**
- Authentication failures
- Authorization denials
- Unusual access patterns
- Failed admin operations

### **Key Metrics**
- Successful vs failed database operations
- Authentication success rates
- Admin operation frequency
- Data access patterns
