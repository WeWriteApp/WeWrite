## üìÅ Documentation Organization

All documentation files have been moved from the root directory to this `docs/` folder for better organization. File names have been converted from `ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES.md` to `Title Case With Spaces.md` for improved readability.

### File Naming Convention

- **Before**: `MOCK_EARNINGS_SYSTEM.md`
- **After**: `Mock Earnings System.md`

This makes the documentation more accessible and professional while maintaining the same content quality.

## üìù Contributing to Documentation

When adding new documentation:

1. **Place files in the `docs/` directory**
2. **Use Title Case naming** (e.g., `New Feature Implementation.md`)
3. **Update this README** to include the new documentation
4. **Follow the existing documentation structure** with clear sections and examples
5. **Include implementation details, testing procedures, and troubleshooting**

## üèóÔ∏è Documentation Standards

All documentation should include:

- **Overview** - Brief description of the feature/system
- **Implementation Details** - Technical specifics and code examples
- **Testing Procedures** - How to validate the implementation
- **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions
- **Future Considerations** - Potential improvements or known limitations

This ensures consistency and usefulness across all documentation files.
