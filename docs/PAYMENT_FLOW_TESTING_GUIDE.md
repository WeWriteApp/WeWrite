# Payment Flow Testing Guide

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for testing all payment flows in the WeWrite application to prepare for release.

## Overview

The payment flow testing suite covers all aspects of the token-based payment system:

- **Subscription Management**: Setup, activation, cancellation, and billing cycles
- **Token Economy**: Purchasing, allocation, and balance management
- **Token States**: Unfunded (logged-out, no subscription, over-budget) and funded (pending, locked)
- **Earnings System**: Writer earnings tracking, dashboard, and calculations
- **Payout Processing**: Requests, fee calculations, bank transfers, and status tracking
- **Integration**: End-to-end flows and cross-service communication

## ✅ Recent Updates

**Payment Feature Flags Removed** (2025-01-24): All payment functionality is now always enabled. No feature flags control payment access.

**Theme Switching Optimized** (2025-01-24): Stripe Elements and payment forms now switch themes instantly in dark mode.

## Quick Start

## Running Tests

### Development Testing

```bash
# Run all payment flow tests
npm run test:payment-flows

# Run specific test suite
npm run test:payment-flows:subscription

# List all available test suites
npm run test:payment-flows:list
```

### CI/CD Integration

Add to your CI/CD pipeline:

```yaml
- name: Run Payment Flow Tests
  run: npm run test:payment-flows
  env:
    NODE_ENV: test
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: ${{ secrets.STRIPE_TEST_SECRET_KEY }}
    STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET: ${{ secrets.STRIPE_TEST_WEBHOOK_SECRET }}
```

### Production Readiness Testing

Before release, ensure all tests pass:

```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite
npm run test:payment-flows

# Check test coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run performance tests
npm run test:flows:performance
```

## Interpreting Results

### Success Indicators

- ✅ All test suites pass
- ✅ No critical errors in logs
- ✅ Performance metrics within acceptable ranges
- ✅ Error handling scenarios work correctly

### Common Issues

1. **Mock Service Failures**
   - Check mock configurations
   - Verify test data setup
   - Review service dependencies

2. **Timing Issues**
   - Increase test timeouts if needed
   - Check for race conditions
   - Verify async/await usage

3. **Data Consistency**
   - Ensure test data is properly reset
   - Check cross-service communication
   - Verify transaction rollbacks

## Troubleshooting

### Debug Individual Tests

```bash
# Run with verbose output
npx jest app/tests/subscriptionFlow.test.ts --verbose

# Run specific test case
npx jest app/tests/subscriptionFlow.test.ts -t "should create basic subscription"

# Run with debugging
npx jest app/tests/subscriptionFlow.test.ts --detectOpenHandles --forceExit
```

### Common Solutions

1. **Test Timeouts**: Increase timeout in jest.config.js
2. **Mock Issues**: Check mock implementations in test setup
3. **Environment Issues**: Verify all required environment variables
4. **Database Issues**: Ensure test database is properly configured

## Best Practices

1. **Run tests frequently** during development
2. **Test edge cases** and error scenarios
3. **Verify cross-service integration** points
4. **Monitor performance** metrics
5. **Keep test data** up to date with production scenarios
