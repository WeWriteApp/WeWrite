## ðŸŽ¯ **Overview**

WeWrite now uses **Stripe's Storage Balance** system for perfect fund separation and enhanced auditability. This guide explains how the system works and what you'll see in your Stripe dashboard.

## ðŸ’° **Understanding Your Stripe Dashboard**

### **Payments Balance**
- **What it contains:** Your platform revenue
- **Sources:** Platform fees (7%) + unallocated subscription funds
- **Usage:** This is your money - transfer to business bank account anytime
- **Example:** $3,000 in Payments Balance = $3,000 you can keep

### **Storage Balance** 
- **What it contains:** Creator obligations (escrowed funds)
- **Sources:** User allocations to creators
- **Usage:** Automatically paid out to creators monthly
- **Example:** $7,000 in Storage Balance = $7,000 owed to creators

### **Total Balance**
- **What it shows:** Payments Balance + Storage Balance
- **Example:** $3,000 + $7,000 = $10,000 total

## ðŸ”„ **How Funds Flow**

### **1. Subscription Payment**
```
User pays $10 subscription â†’ Payments Balance (+$10)
```

### **2. User Allocates Funds**
```
User allocates $7 to creators â†’ Storage Balance (+$7)
                              â†’ Payments Balance (-$7)
```

### **3. Month-End "Use It or Lose It"**
```
Unallocated $3 â†’ Stays in Payments Balance (platform revenue)
```

### **4. Monthly Payouts**
```
Storage Balance ($7) â†’ Creator bank accounts
Storage Balance â†’ $0 (after payouts)
```

---

## ðŸ“Š **Monthly Processing Cycle**

### **Throughout the Month:**
- **Subscriptions** â†’ Payments Balance
- **User allocations** â†’ Storage Balance (escrowed)
- **Unallocated funds** â†’ Stay in Payments Balance

### **Month-End Processing:**
1. **Lock allocations** (no more changes allowed)
2. **Calculate earnings** (with 7% platform fee)
3. **Process payouts** from Storage Balance
4. **Platform revenue** remains in Payments Balance

### **Result:**
- **Storage Balance** â†’ Near $0 (after payouts)
- **Payments Balance** â†’ Contains your platform revenue

## ðŸš¨ **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Scenarios:**

**Q: Storage Balance is higher than expected**
- **A:** Users allocated more than usual - this is normal

**Q: Payments Balance is lower than expected**
- **A:** More funds moved to Storage Balance - check allocation rates

**Q: Storage Balance didn't clear after payouts**
- **A:** Some creators may not be eligible - check payout logs

**Q: What happens to funds when creators haven't set up bank accounts?**
- **A:** Funds remain in Storage Balance indefinitely until bank account is connected. No automatic cleanup or timeout mechanisms exist.

**Q: Do unpaid funds ever move back to Payments Balance?**
- **A:** No. Only unallocated subscription funds move to Payments Balance via "use it or lose it". Allocated funds stay in Storage Balance until paid out.

**Q: Balances don't match internal tracking**
- **A:** Storage Balance is now the source of truth - update internal systems

## ðŸ’° **Fund Retention Policy**

### **Unpaid Creator Funds**
When creators have valid earnings but haven't set up bank accounts:

- **âœ… Funds Remain Safe**: All allocated funds stay in Storage Balance indefinitely
- **âœ… No Expiration**: There are no timeout mechanisms that move funds elsewhere
- **âœ… Accumulation**: Monthly earnings continue to accumulate in Storage Balance
- **âœ… Immediate Access**: Once bank account is connected, all accumulated funds become available for payout

### **What This Means:**
- **For Creators**: Your earnings are safely held until you're ready to receive them
- **For WeWrite**: Storage Balance accurately reflects all outstanding creator obligations
- **For Compliance**: Proper fund segregation ensures regulatory compliance

### **Important Notes:**
- Only **unallocated subscription funds** move to Payments Balance via "use it or lose it"
- **Allocated funds** (creator earnings) never expire or move back to platform revenue
- **Storage Balance** serves as a permanent escrow for creator obligations
