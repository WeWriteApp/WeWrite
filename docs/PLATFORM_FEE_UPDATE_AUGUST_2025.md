# WeWrite Platform Fee Update - August 2025

## Summary

WeWrite's platform fee has been increased from **7%** to **10%** effective August 2025. This change affects all future payouts to creators.

## What Changed

### Previous Fee Structure
- **Platform Fee**: 7%
- **Creators kept**: 93% of earnings (minus payment processing fees)

### New Fee Structure  
- **Platform Fee**: 10%
- **Creators keep**: 90% of earnings (minus payment processing fees)

## Impact on Creators

### Example Payout Calculation

**Before (7% fee):**
- Creator earnings: $100.00
- WeWrite platform fee: $7.00
- Creator receives: $93.00 (minus Stripe fees)

### When This Takes Effect

- **Existing pending payouts**: Use the 7% fee rate that was active when initiated
- **New payouts**: Use the 10% fee rate for all payouts initiated after this update
- **No retroactive changes**: Past completed payouts are not affected

## Technical Implementation

### Centralized Configuration

The platform fee is defined in one place and propagated throughout the system:

**Primary Configuration** (`app/utils/feeCalculations.ts`):
```typescript
export const WEWRITE_FEE_STRUCTURE = {
  platformFeePercentage: 0.10, // 10% - WeWrite platform fee
  // ... other fee settings
};
```

### Updated Components

The following UI components now reflect the 10% fee:

1. **Payout Fee Breakdown** (`app/components/PayoutFeeBreakdown.tsx`)
   - Shows detailed fee calculation to users
   - Displays "Platform fee (10%)" in payout screens

2. **Admin Dashboard** (`app/components/admin/PlatformFeeRevenueWidget.tsx`)
   - Revenue tracking shows "10% of payouts"
   - Analytics reflect new fee structure

3. **Fee Management Interface** (`app/components/admin/FeeManagementSection.tsx`)
   - Admin interface for real-time fee adjustments
   - Shows current 10% rate
