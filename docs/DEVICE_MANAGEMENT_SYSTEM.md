# Device Management System

## Overview

The Device Management System provides users with comprehensive control over their account security by allowing them to view and manage all devices that are currently logged into their WeWrite account.

## Features

### 1. **Device Detection & Tracking**
- Automatic detection of device type (desktop, mobile, tablet)
- Browser and operating system identification
- IP address tracking for security monitoring
- Last activity timestamp for each session

### 2. **Session Management**
- View all active sessions across devices
- Identify current device with special badge
- Remote logout capability for any device
- Automatic session cleanup for expired sessions

### 3. **Security Monitoring**
- Visual indicators for device types
- Clear display of login times and activity
- IP address visibility for location awareness
- Current session highlighting for security

## User Interface

### Device List Display

Each device shows:
- **Device Icon**: Desktop, mobile, or tablet icon
- **Browser & OS**: "Chrome on macOS", "Safari on iOS", etc.
- **Current Device Badge**: Special indicator for the device you're currently using
- **Last Activity**: "Active now", "2 hours ago", etc.
- **IP Address**: For location/network identification
- **Logout Button**: To remotely log out the device

### Visual Elements

```
üñ•Ô∏è Chrome on macOS                    [Current device] [Log out]
   Active now ‚Ä¢ 192.168.1.100

üì± Safari on iOS                                       [Log out]
   2 hours ago ‚Ä¢ 10.0.0.50

üíª Firefox on Windows                                  [Log out]
   1 day ago ‚Ä¢ 203.0.113.42
```

## Technical Implementation

### Components

**Primary Component**: `app/components/settings/LoggedInDevices.tsx`
- Fetches and displays active sessions
- Handles device logout functionality
- Provides refresh capability
- Manages loading and error states

### API Endpoints

**GET `/api/auth/sessions`**
- Returns all active sessions for the current user
- Includes device information and activity data
- Requires authentication
- Works with both production Firebase Auth and development auth

**DELETE `/api/auth/sessions/[sessionId]`**
- Revokes a specific session
- Logs out the target device
- Returns success/error status
- Supports both production and development sessions

### Development Environment Support

**Dev Auth Compatibility**: The device management system fully supports development authentication:
- Dev auth sessions create proper session records in `DEV_userSessions` collection
- Session validation works correctly for `dev_session_` prefixed session IDs
- Device information is captured and stored for dev users
- Remote logout functionality works for development test accounts
- All device management features available during local development

### Data Structures

```typescript
interface DeviceInfo {
  userAgent: string;
  platform: string;
  browser: string;
  os: string;
  deviceType: 'desktop' | 'mobile' | 'tablet';
  location?: string;
}

interface UserSession {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  deviceInfo: DeviceInfo;
  createdAt: string;
  lastActiveAt: string;
  ipAddress: string;
  isCurrentSession: boolean;
}
```

## Security Benefits

### For Users
- **Visibility**: See all devices accessing their account
- **Control**: Ability to log out suspicious or forgotten devices
- **Awareness**: Monitor account access patterns
- **Peace of Mind**: Know exactly where their account is being accessed

### For Platform Security
- **Audit Trail**: Track device access patterns
- **Incident Response**: Quick device revocation in case of compromise
- **Session Management**: Automatic cleanup of expired sessions
- **Monitoring**: IP address tracking for suspicious activity

## Usage Instructions

### Accessing Device Management
1. Navigate to Settings
2. Go to Security section
3. Click on "Logged-in Devices" or similar option
4. View the `LoggedInDevices` component

### Managing Devices
1. **View Devices**: All active sessions are displayed automatically
2. **Identify Current Device**: Look for the "Current device" badge
3. **Log Out Device**: Click "Log out" button next to any device
4. **Refresh List**: Use refresh button to update the device list

### Security Best Practices
1. **Regular Review**: Check logged-in devices regularly
2. **Unknown Devices**: Immediately log out any unrecognized devices
3. **Public Computers**: Always log out when using shared/public devices
4. **Suspicious Activity**: Report any suspicious login patterns

## Error Handling

### Common Scenarios
- **Network Errors**: Graceful handling with retry options
- **Session Expiry**: Automatic redirect to login if current session expires
- **API Failures**: Clear error messages with suggested actions
- **Concurrent Logouts**: Handle multiple device logouts gracefully

### User Feedback
- **Success Messages**: Confirmation when devices are logged out
- **Error Messages**: Clear explanations when operations fail
- **Loading States**: Visual indicators during API operations
- **Empty States**: Helpful message when no other devices are logged in

## Integration Points

### Settings Page
The device management component integrates into the user settings interface, typically under a "Security" or "Account" section.

### Authentication System
Works seamlessly with the existing Firebase Auth and session cookie system without requiring additional authentication flows.

### Session Tracking
Leverages the existing session management infrastructure to provide real-time device tracking and management capabilities.

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Features
- **Device Naming**: Allow users to name their devices
- **Login Notifications**: Email alerts for new device logins
- **Geographic Location**: Show approximate location based on IP
- **Session Duration**: Display how long each session has been active
- **Bulk Actions**: Log out all other devices with one click

### Security Improvements
- **Suspicious Activity Detection**: Automatic flagging of unusual login patterns
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Enhanced security for device management
- **Login History**: Extended history beyond just active sessions
- **Device Fingerprinting**: More sophisticated device identification

## Conclusion

The Device Management System enhances WeWrite's security posture by providing users with comprehensive visibility and control over their account access. This feature empowers users to maintain better security hygiene while providing the platform with valuable audit capabilities.
