# WeWrite Native App Migration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines WeWrite's strategic plan for migrating from a Progressive Web App (PWA) to native mobile applications while maintaining the existing web platform. The migration is designed to be incremental, preserving all current functionality while adding native-specific capabilities.

## Current PWA Foundation

### ✅ PWA Features Already Implemented

**Installation & Offline Support:**
- PWA installation prompts and tracking
- Service worker for offline functionality
- App manifest with proper icons and metadata
- Standalone display mode support

**Notification System:**
- Comprehensive notification architecture with criticality levels
- In-app notification display and management
- Notification preferences system with push/in-app toggles
- Email verification and system notifications

**Authentication & Data:**
- Robust authentication system with account switching
- Environment-aware data fetching (production data for logged-out users)
- Optimized caching with 90% read reduction
- Real-time data synchronization

## Native App Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-2)
**Goal:** Establish native app development infrastructure

**React Native Setup:**
- Initialize React Native project with Expo or bare workflow
- Set up shared codebase architecture (web + native)
- Implement navigation structure matching current web app
- Port authentication system to native

**Shared Components:**
- Create shared component library for UI consistency
- Port core business logic to shared utilities
- Implement shared state management (Redux/Zustand)
- Set up shared API layer

### Phase 2: Core Features (Months 3-4)
**Goal:** Implement essential WeWrite functionality

**Content Management:**
- Page creation, editing, and viewing
- Rich text editor with native optimizations
- Image upload and media handling
- Offline content synchronization

**Financial System:**
- Fund allocation and spending
- Earnings tracking and payouts
- Stripe integration for payments
- Balance management and notifications

### Phase 3: Native Enhancements (Months 5-6)
**Goal:** Add native-specific features and optimizations

**Device Integration:**
- Native push notifications with FCM/APNs
- Biometric authentication (Face ID, Touch ID)
- Native sharing capabilities
- Camera integration for content creation

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Native navigation animations
- Optimized image caching and loading
- Background sync for content updates
- Native database for offline storage

## Notification System Migration

### Current PWA Notification Architecture

**Notification Types:**
```typescript
const NOTIFICATION_TYPES = [
  'follow', 'like', 'comment', 'mention',
  'payout_completed', 'payout_failed', 
  'email_verification', 'system_updates'
];
```

**Preference System:**
- Push notifications (device-level)
- In-app alerts (application-level)
- Per-type granular controls
- Criticality levels: 'device', 'normal', 'hidden'

### Native Notification Enhancements

**Device Notification APIs:**
```typescript
// iOS - User Notifications Framework
import UserNotifications from '@react-native-community/push-notification-ios';

// Android - Firebase Cloud Messaging
import messaging from '@react-native-firebase/messaging';

interface NativeNotificationConfig {
  sound: boolean;
  badge: boolean;
  alert: boolean;
  vibration: boolean;
  priority: 'high' | 'normal' | 'low';
}
```

**Enhanced Features:**
- Rich notifications with images and actions
- Notification grouping and threading
- Custom notification sounds
- Scheduled local notifications
- Background notification handling

### Migration-Safe Notification System

**Unified Notification Service:**
```typescript
interface NotificationService {
  // Current PWA methods (preserved)
  createNotification(data: NotificationData): Promise<string>;
  getNotifications(limit?: number): Promise<NotificationResult>;
  markAsRead(id: string): Promise<void>;
  
  // New native methods
  requestPermissions(): Promise<boolean>;
  registerDeviceToken(token: string): Promise<void>;
  scheduleLocalNotification(data: LocalNotificationData): Promise<void>;
  handleBackgroundNotification(data: any): Promise<void>;
}
```

**Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
- Shared notification data models
- Platform-specific rendering logic
- Graceful degradation for unsupported features
- Consistent user experience across platforms

## Technical Architecture

### Shared Codebase Structure
```
wewrite/
├── packages/
│   ├── shared/           # Shared business logic
│   │   ├── api/         # API clients and services
│   │   ├── types/       # TypeScript definitions
│   │   ├── utils/       # Utility functions
│   │   └── constants/   # App constants
│   ├── web/             # Next.js web app (current)
│   ├── mobile/          # React Native app (new)
│   └── components/      # Shared UI components
```

### Data Synchronization Strategy

**Offline-First Architecture:**
- Local SQLite database for native apps
- Sync queue for offline operations
- Conflict resolution strategies
- Background sync capabilities

**API Compatibility:**
- Maintain existing REST API endpoints
- Add GraphQL for efficient mobile queries
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- Optimistic updates for better UX

### Authentication Migration

**Current System Preservation:**
- Keep existing Firebase Auth integration
- Maintain account switching functionality
- Preserve logout mechanisms and session management

**Native Enhancements:**
- Biometric authentication options
- Secure keychain storage for tokens
- Background token refresh
- Deep linking for authentication flows
