# WeWrite Payout Testing Infrastructure

## Overview

WeWrite provides a comprehensive testing infrastructure for validating the complete payout flow from token earnings to bank transfers. This system enables thorough testing of connected accounts, platform fee calculations, and Stripe transfers in test mode without affecting production data.

## Core Components

### PayoutFlowValidator

**Location**: `app/components/admin/PayoutFlowValidator.tsx`  
**Access**: Admin Dashboard â†’ Testing Tools section

The PayoutFlowValidator is the primary interface for testing payout functionality. It provides:

- **Fee Calculation Testing**: Validates all fee calculations with configurable test amounts
- **Platform Fee Verification**: Confirms WeWrite's 7% platform fee is correctly calculated and displayed
- **Mathematical Validation**: Ensures fee calculations are mathematically accurate
- **Minimum Threshold Testing**: Validates $25 minimum payout enforcement
- **Payout Method Comparison**: Tests standard vs instant payout fee differences
- **Real-time Fee Breakdown**: Shows exactly what users see during payout requests

### Connected Account Management

**Components**:
- `EmbeddedBankAccountSetup.tsx`: Stripe Connect onboarding flow
- `EmbeddedBankAccountManager.tsx`: Account management interface
- `TestFinancialConnectionsButton.tsx`: Test interface for bank connections

**Features**:
- Stripe Connect embedded components for seamless account setup
- Multiple connection methods (Financial Connections, manual entry)
- Test mode support with Stripe test bank accounts
- Real-time account verification status

### Payout Processing System

**Service**: `StripePayoutService`  
**API**: `/api/payouts/earnings`

**Capabilities**:
- Actual transfer execution to connected accounts
- Platform fee deduction (7% WeWrite fee)
- Stripe payout fee calculation
- Transfer status tracking and webhooks
- Error handling and retry logic

## Testing Interfaces

### Admin Dashboard Testing

**Access**: `/admin/dashboard`  
**Section**: Testing Tools

**Available Tests**:
1. **Payout Flow Validation**: Comprehensive fee and flow testing
2. **Monthly Distribution**: Token earnings processing simulation
3. **System Status Checks**: Overall payout system health validation

### API Testing Endpoints

**Test Payout Flow**: `POST /api/admin/test-payout-flow`
- Creates test writer account with earnings
- Processes complete payout flow
- Returns detailed step-by-step results

**Fee Calculation**: `POST /api/payouts/calculate-fees`
- Tests fee calculations for any amount
- Supports standard and instant payout methods
- Returns comprehensive fee breakdown

**Earnings Management**: `GET/POST /api/payouts/earnings`
- Retrieves user earnings data
- Processes payout requests
- Handles minimum threshold validation

## Fee Structure Testing

### Platform Fee Transparency

WeWrite's payout system provides complete fee transparency:

**Fee Components**:
- **Gross Earnings**: Total token value earned
- **WeWrite Platform Fee**: 7% of gross earnings
- **Stripe Payout Fee**: Variable based on payout method
- **Net Payout Amount**: Final amount transferred to bank

**Validation Points**:
- Mathematical accuracy of all calculations
- Proper fee display in user interface
- Correct deduction order and timing
- Currency formatting and precision

### Test Scenarios

**Standard Test Cases**:
- $25 minimum threshold validation
- $100 standard payout fee calculation
- $500 instant payout fee comparison
- Edge cases (very small/large amounts)

**Error Conditions**:
- Below minimum threshold attempts
- Invalid connected account scenarios
- Network failure simulation
- Insufficient balance conditions

## Stripe Test Mode Integration

### Test Environment Setup

**Configuration**:
- Stripe test keys automatically selected in development
- Test connected accounts created via Stripe Connect
- Test bank accounts provided by Stripe
- Webhook endpoints configured for test events

**Test Data**:
- Mock user accounts with earnings balances
- Simulated token allocation history
- Test connected account configurations
- Sample payout transaction records

### Transfer Testing

**Process**:
1. Create test connected account via embedded components
2. Generate test earnings using admin tools
3. Execute payout request through PayoutFlowValidator
4. Monitor transfer in Stripe test dashboard
5. Verify webhook processing and status updates

**Verification Points**:
- Transfer amount matches calculated net payout
- Platform fee properly deducted
- Transfer appears in Stripe dashboard
- Webhook events processed correctly
- User interface updates reflect transfer status

## Documentation and Monitoring

### Test Results Tracking

**PayoutFlowValidator Output**:
- Step-by-step validation results
- Success/failure status for each component
- Detailed error messages and debugging information
- Performance metrics and timing data

**Admin Dashboard Monitoring**:
- Real-time payout system status
- Transfer success/failure rates
- Fee calculation accuracy metrics
- Connected account health checks

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues**:
- Stripe test key configuration
- Connected account setup failures
- Fee calculation discrepancies
- Webhook processing delays

**Resolution Steps**:
1. Verify Stripe test mode configuration
2. Check connected account status in Stripe dashboard
3. Validate fee calculation logic using PayoutFlowValidator
4. Review webhook endpoint configuration and logs

## Usage Guidelines

### For Developers

**Testing New Features**:
1. Use PayoutFlowValidator to validate fee calculations
2. Test connected account flows with embedded components
3. Verify API endpoints using admin testing tools
4. Monitor Stripe dashboard for transfer confirmation

**Before Deployment**:
1. Run complete payout flow validation
2. Verify all fee calculations are accurate
3. Test error handling scenarios
4. Confirm webhook processing works correctly

### For Administrators

**Regular Monitoring**:
