# WeWrite Simplified Activity System

## Overview

WeWrite's activity system has been completely refactored from a complex multi-collection approach to a simple, reliable system based on the unified version system with embedded token allocation controls.

## üöÄ Latest Updates (July 2025)

### Recent Edits System Overhaul
- **‚úÖ Fixed Data Gaps**: Increased fetch limits from 60 to 400 pages to eliminate massive timeline gaps
- **‚úÖ Smart Token Controls**: Added conditional token allocation bars (hidden on user's own pages)
- **‚úÖ Include Own Edits**: Changed default to show user's own recent edits for complete activity feed
- **‚úÖ Unified Version System**: All recent edits now pull from the consolidated version system

## Architecture

### Before: Complex Activity System ‚ùå
```
Page Save ‚Üí Create Activity Record ‚Üí Store in Activities Collection
Homepage ‚Üí Query Activities Collection ‚Üí Complex filtering/processing
Activity Page ‚Üí Query Activities Collection ‚Üí More complex processing
```

**Problems:**
- Separate activities collection to maintain
- Complex queries across multiple collections
- Caching issues and stale data
- Permission problems with activities collection
- Duplicate data storage and sync issues

### After: Simplified Recent Pages System ‚úÖ
```
Page Save ‚Üí Store diff data on page document
Homepage ‚Üí Query recent pages ‚Üí Show pages with diff data
Activity Page ‚Üí Query recent pages ‚Üí Show pages with diff data
```

**Benefits:**
- Single source of truth (pages collection)
- No separate activities collection needed
- Simpler queries and faster responses
- Automatic consistency (diff data lives with page)
- Easier to maintain and debug

### 2025 Performance Optimizations ‚úÖ
```
Progressive Loading: 15 ‚Üí 25 ‚Üí 30 ‚Üí 50 items per batch
Smart Fetch Limits: 160 pages (8x multiplier) for balanced performance
Conditional Token UI: Only show allocation controls where functional
```

**Performance Benefits:**
- **Fast Initial Paint**: 15 items load immediately
- **Continuous Timeline**: No 4-month gaps in recent activity
- **Optimal Batching**: Increasing batch sizes for smooth infinite scroll
- **Smart UX**: Token allocation only appears for other users' pages

## Recent Edits API Architecture (2025)

### Critical Performance Fixes

The recent edits system underwent major performance and data integrity improvements:

#### 1. Increased Fetch Limits
```typescript
// OLD: Insufficient data causing gaps
.limit(limit * 3); // Only 60 pages total

// NEW: Adequate data for continuous timeline
.limit(limit * 20); // 400 pages for general recent edits
.limit(limit * 10); // 200 pages for user-specific edits
```

**Problem Solved**: The API was only fetching 60 pages before applying heavy filtering (visibility, ownership, deleted status), leaving massive 4-month gaps in the timeline.

#### 2. Smart Token Allocation Controls
```typescript
// Only show token allocation for other users' pages
{activity.userId && activity.pageId && user?.uid !== activity.userId && (
  <EmbeddedTokenAllocation
    pageId={activity.pageId}
    authorId={activity.userId}
    pageTitle={currentPageName}
    source="HomePage"
  />
)}
```

**Benefit**: Users no longer see confusing token allocation controls on their own pages where allocation isn't possible.

#### 3. Include Own Edits by Default
```typescript
// NEW: Show complete activity feed including user's own edits
includeOwn: true, // Users want to see all recent activity including their own
```

**Rationale**: Most recent activity comes from the logged-in user, so excluding their own edits created artificially sparse feeds.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Diff Data Storage on Pages

When a page is saved, diff information is calculated and stored directly on the page document:

```typescript
// In saveNewVersion function
await setDoc(doc(db, getCollectionName("pages"), pageId), {
  currentVersion: versionRef.id,
  content: contentString,
  lastModified: now,
  lastDiff: diffResult ? {
    added: diffResult.added || 0,
    removed: diffResult.removed || 0,
    hasChanges: (diffResult.added > 0 || diffResult.removed > 0) || isNewPage,
    preview: diffResult.preview || null
  } : null
}, { merge: true });
```

### 2. Recent Pages API

The `/api/home` endpoint already fetches recent pages by `lastModified`. These pages now include `lastDiff` data:

```json
{
  "id": "page-id",
  "title": "Page Title",
  "lastModified": "2025-07-11T19:22:11.378Z",
  "lastDiff": {
    "added": 12,
    "removed": 60,
    "hasChanges": true,
    "preview": {
      "addedText": "new content",
      "removedText": "old content",
      "hasAdditions": true,
      "hasRemovals": true
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. RecentPagesActivity Component

A unified component that:
- Fetches recent pages from `/api/home`
- Filters pages with meaningful changes (`lastDiff.hasChanges`)
- Converts pages to activity format for ActivityCard compatibility
- Supports both carousel (homepage) and grid (activity page) layouts
- Includes filtering (All/Following/Mine)

```typescript
// Usage examples
<RecentPagesActivity limit={8} isCarousel={true} />   // Homepage carousel
<RecentPagesActivity limit={50} isCarousel={false} /> // Activity page grid
```

### 4. Activity Card Compatibility

The existing `ActivityCard` component works seamlessly with the new system by converting page data to activity format:

```typescript
const convertPageToActivity = (page: RecentPage) => ({
  pageId: page.id,
  pageName: page.title || 'Untitled',
  userId: page.userId,
  username: page.username,
  timestamp: new Date(page.lastModified),
  isPublic: true,
  isNewPage: false,
  diff: page.lastDiff ? {
    added: page.lastDiff.added,
    removed: page.lastDiff.removed,
    hasChanges: page.lastDiff.hasChanges
  } : null,
  diffPreview: page.lastDiff?.preview || null
});
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Patterns That Must Be Sanitized

### üö® Old Patterns - DELETE ON SIGHT

These patterns are **DANGEROUS** and must be **COMPLETELY DELETED**:

#### 1. Activities Collection References
```typescript
// ‚ùå DELETE IMMEDIATELY - Activities collection is deprecated
db.collection(getCollectionName('activities'))
db.collection('DEV_activities')
db.collection('activities')
```

#### 2. Old Recent-Edits Implementations
```typescript
// ‚ùå DELETE IMMEDIATELY - Wrong approach
const recentEdits = await fetch('/api/recent-edits?filterToUser=...');
// Should use: await fetch('/api/recent-pages?userId=...');
```

#### 3. Manual Activity Creation
```typescript
// ‚ùå DELETE IMMEDIATELY - Activities are auto-generated from versions
await createActivity({ pageId, userId, type: 'edit' });
```

#### 4. Complex Activity Queries
```typescript
// ‚ùå DELETE IMMEDIATELY - Use simplified recent pages approach
db.collection('activities').where('userId', '==', userId).orderBy('createdAt', 'desc')
```

### üîç Sanitization Commands

Run these commands to find and **DELETE** dangerous patterns:
```bash
# Find activities collection references
grep -r "collection.*activities" app/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.js"

# Find old recent-edits patterns
grep -r "api/recent-edits.*filterToUser" app/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx"

# Find manual activity creation
grep -r "createActivity\|addActivity" app/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx"
```

## Removed Components

The following components were completely removed as part of the cleanup:

### Deleted Files
- `app/api/activity/route.js` - Old activity API endpoint
- `app/hooks/useRecentActivity.js` - Complex activity hook
- `app/components/features/RecentActivity.tsx` - Old activity component
- `app/components/features/RecentActivityHeader.tsx` - Old header component
- `app/services/activityService.ts` - Activity service layer
- `app/api/test-activity/route.js` - Test endpoints
- `test-activity-api.js` - Test scripts
- `check-activities.mjs` - Debug scripts

### Removed Code
- Activity creation logic from `saveNewVersion()` function
- Activity creation logic from `createPage()` function
- All references to activities collection
- Complex activity filtering and processing logic

## Performance Improvements

### Cache Optimization
- Reduced recent pages cache from 2 minutes to 10 seconds for faster updates
- Eliminated complex activity collection queries
- Single API call instead of multiple chained queries

### Database Efficiency
- No more activities collection writes on every page save
- Reduced Firestore operations by ~50%
- Simpler queries with better performance characteristics

## Migration Notes

### No Data Migration Required
- Existing pages continue to work normally
- New `lastDiff` data is added on next page edit
- Old activities collection can be safely ignored/deleted

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing page URLs continue to work
- ActivityCard component maintains same interface
- No changes required to page viewing/editing functionality

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live activity feeds
2. **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by content type, time ranges, etc.
3. **Activity Analytics**: Track engagement and popular content
4. **Batch Operations**: Bulk diff calculations for historical data

### Monitoring
- Monitor `/api/home` response times
- Track cache hit rates and effectiveness
- Monitor page save performance with diff calculations

## Conclusion

The simplified activity system provides:
- ‚úÖ **Reliability**: Single source of truth eliminates sync issues
- ‚úÖ **Performance**: Faster queries and reduced database load
- ‚úÖ **Maintainability**: Simpler codebase with fewer moving parts
- ‚úÖ **Scalability**: Linear performance characteristics
- ‚úÖ **User Experience**: Faster loading and more responsive UI

This refactor represents a significant improvement in system architecture while maintaining full feature compatibility.
