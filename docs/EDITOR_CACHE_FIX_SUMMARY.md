# Editor Cache Fix - Preventing Stale Content After Save

## 🎯 **Problem Identified**

After saving a page, the editor was showing stale (old) content while the actual save was successful. This created a critical issue where:

1. **Save succeeded** - Changes were properly saved to database
2. **Recent edits showed new content** - Confirming save worked
3. **Public/logged-out view showed new content** - Confirming save worked
4. **Editor showed old content** - Due to caching and state management issues
5. **Risk of data loss** - Further edits would be based on stale content

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

The issue was caused by multiple problematic patterns in the save process:

### **1. Editor State Reset Race Condition**
```typescript
// PROBLEMATIC CODE (before fix):
setEditorState([]);
setTimeout(() => {
  setEditorState(contentToSave);
}, 100);
```
This created a race condition where the editor was cleared and then set again, potentially interfering with other state updates.

### **2. Fresh Data Fetch Override**
```typescript
// PROBLEMATIC CODE (before fix):
const response = await fetch(`/api/pages/${pageId}?bustCache=${Date.now()}`);
const freshPageData = await response.json();
setEditorState(parsedContent); // This could override the saved content!
```
The system was fetching "fresh" data from the server after save, but due to caching, this could return stale content that overrode the correct saved content.

### **3. Data Loading Race Condition**
The main data loading `useEffect` could trigger during or immediately after save, potentially reloading stale cached data.

## ✅ **Fixes Implemented**

### **Fix 1: Eliminate Editor State Reset**
```typescript
// BEFORE (problematic):
setEditorState([]);
setTimeout(() => {
  setEditorState(contentToSave);
}, 100);

// AFTER (fixed):
setEditorState(contentToSave); // Direct update, no reset
```

### **Fix 2: Remove Fresh Data Fetch After Save**
```typescript
// BEFORE (problematic):
const response = await fetch(`/api/pages/${pageId}?bustCache=${Date.now()}`);
// ... fetch and override editor state

// AFTER (fixed):
// NOTE: We don't need to fetch fresh data from server here because:
// 1. We already updated page state and editor state with the saved content above
// 2. The saved content IS the fresh content (we just saved it)
// 3. Fetching again creates a race condition that can show stale cached content
```

### **Fix 3: Prevent Data Reloading After Save**
```typescript
// NEW: Added justSaved flag
const [justSaved, setJustSaved] = useState(false);

// In save function:
setJustSaved(true);
setTimeout(() => {
  setJustSaved(false);
}, 2000); // Prevent reloading for 2 seconds after save

// In data loading useEffect:
if (justSaved) {
  console.log('Skipping data loading - just saved, using current editor state');
  return;
}
```

## 🎯 **How the Fix Works**

### **Save Process (New Flow):**
1. **User saves content** → `handleSave()` called
2. **Content sent to API** → Save succeeds in database
3. **Page state updated** → `setPage(updatedPage)`
4. **Editor state updated directly** → `setEditorState(contentToSave)` (no reset!)
5. **justSaved flag set** → Prevents data reloading for 2 seconds
6. **Caches cleared** → But no fresh fetch that could override content
7. **Editor shows correct content** → The content that was just saved

### **Key Principles:**
- **Saved content IS fresh content** - No need to fetch from server
- **Direct state updates** - No resets or race conditions
- **Prevent interference** - Block data reloading immediately after save
- **Trust the save** - The content we just saved is the correct content

---

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix**

### **Test Scenario:**
1. **Open a page in editor**
2. **Make changes to content**
3. **Save the page** (Cmd+S or Save button)
4. **Verify editor shows the saved content** (not old content)
5. **Make additional changes** (should be based on correct content)
6. **Save again** (should work correctly)

### **Expected Results:**
- ✅ **Editor shows saved content immediately after save**
- ✅ **No reversion to old content**
- ✅ **Subsequent edits work correctly**
- ✅ **No data loss or edit conflicts**

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **Files Modified:**
- `app/components/pages/PageView.tsx` - Main save logic and state management

### **Key Changes:**
1. **Line 1154**: Removed problematic editor state reset
2. **Line 1181**: Removed fresh data fetch that could show stale content
3. **Line 140**: Added `justSaved` flag to prevent data reloading
4. **Line 1226**: Set `justSaved` flag in save completion
5. **Line 436**: Check `justSaved` flag in data loading useEffect
6. **Line 598**: FIXED - Removed `justSaved` from useEffect dependencies to prevent unnecessary reloads

### **State Management:**
```typescript
// New state for preventing reload after save
const [justSaved, setJustSaved] = useState(false);

// Save completion logic
setJustSaved(true);
setTimeout(() => setJustSaved(false), 2000);

// Data loading prevention
if (justSaved) return; // Skip data loading
```

## 🎉 **Benefits of the Fix**

### **Immediate Benefits:**
- ✅ **Editor shows correct content after save**
- ✅ **No more stale content issues**
- ✅ **Prevents data loss from edit conflicts**
- ✅ **Improved user experience and trust**

### **Long-term Benefits:**
- ✅ **Simplified save logic** - Less complex state management
- ✅ **Reduced race conditions** - Fewer timing-dependent bugs
- ✅ **Better performance** - No unnecessary server fetches
- ✅ **More reliable editing** - Consistent editor state

## 🔧 **Final Fix: useEffect Dependency Issue**

### **Problem Discovered:**
Even after the initial fixes, the editor was still showing stale content after save because the `justSaved` flag was included in the useEffect dependency array. This caused:

1. **Save triggers useEffect** → `justSaved` changes from `false` to `true`
2. **useEffect runs but skips loading** → Due to guard clause
3. **2 seconds later** → `justSaved` changes from `true` to `false`
4. **useEffect runs again** → This time loads data, potentially showing stale cached content

### **Final Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (problematic):
}, [pageId, user?.uid, showVersion, versionId, showDiff, compareVersionId, justSaved]);

// AFTER (fixed):
}, [pageId, user?.uid, showVersion, versionId, showDiff, compareVersionId]);
```

### **Why This Works:**
- `justSaved` is still used as a guard condition to prevent immediate post-save data loading
- But it no longer triggers the useEffect when it changes
- useEffect only runs when actual data dependencies change (pageId, user, etc.)
- This prevents the problematic reload cycle that was showing stale content

## 🚨 **Important Notes**

### **Cache Invalidation Still Works:**
- All caches are still properly cleared after save
- This ensures other parts of the app see fresh content
- Only the unnecessary server fetch was removed

### **Real-time Updates Still Work:**
- `pageSaved` events are still emitted
- Other components still get notified of changes
- Recent edits and public views still update correctly

### **Backward Compatibility:**
- All existing functionality preserved
- No breaking changes to API or components
- Only improved the save completion logic

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

The fix is successful when:
- ✅ **Editor content matches saved content immediately after save**
- ✅ **No reversion to old content after save**
- ✅ **Subsequent edits work on correct content**
- ✅ **Save process is faster and more reliable**
- ✅ **No edit conflicts or data loss**

**The editor cache issue has been resolved!** 🚀
