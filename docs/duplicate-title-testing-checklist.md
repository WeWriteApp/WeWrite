## API Endpoint Tests

### Direct API Testing
- [ ] Open browser dev tools, go to Console tab
- [ ] Test unique title:
  ```javascript
  fetch('/api/pages/check-duplicate?title=Unique Test Title 123', {credentials: 'include'})
    .then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)
  ```
- [ ] **Expected**: `{success: true, data: {isDuplicate: false, existingPage: null}}`

- [ ] Test duplicate title (replace with actual title you own):
  ```javascript
  fetch('/api/pages/check-duplicate?title=Your Existing Title', {credentials: 'include'})
    .then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)
  ```
- [ ] **Expected**: `{success: false, error: "You already have...", data: {isDuplicate: true, existingPage: {...}}}`

### Authentication Tests
- [ ] Log out of your account
- [ ] Try the API call above
- [ ] **Expected**: Should return 401 Unauthorized

### Error Handling Tests
- [ ] Test missing title parameter:
  ```javascript
  fetch('/api/pages/check-duplicate', {credentials: 'include'})
    .then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)
  ```
- [ ] **Expected**: Should return 400 Bad Request

## Related Pages Verification

### Same Title from Other Users
- [ ] Create a page with title "Test Topic"
- [ ] Have another user (or test account) create page with same title "Test Topic"
- [ ] View your page
- [ ] Scroll to "Others' Related Pages" section
- [ ] **Expected**: Should see the other user's page with same title

### Different Users, Different Titles
- [ ] Verify that pages with different titles but similar content appear in related pages
- [ ] **Expected**: Related pages should work as before

## Error Scenarios

### Network Issues
- [ ] Open dev tools, go to Network tab
- [ ] Set network to "Slow 3G" or "Offline"
- [ ] Try to create page with duplicate title
- [ ] **Expected**: Should handle gracefully, show appropriate error message

### Server Errors
- [ ] This requires backend testing or mocking server errors
- [ ] **Expected**: Should show user-friendly error messages, not expose technical details

## User Experience Validation

### Modal Behavior
- [ ] Verify duplicate modal can be closed with X button
- [ ] Verify content warning modal can be closed with X button
- [ ] Verify modals are accessible (can be navigated with keyboard)
- [ ] Verify modals appear above other content (z-index)

### Error Messages
- [ ] Verify all error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Verify error messages provide actionable guidance
- [ ] Verify error messages include the specific title that caused the conflict

### Performance
- [ ] Check that duplicate checking doesn't cause noticeable delays
- [ ] Verify debouncing works (not too many API calls while typing)
- [ ] Check console for any performance warnings

## Edge Cases

### Special Characters in Titles
- [ ] Test titles with emojis: "My Page ðŸš€"
- [ ] Test titles with special characters: "My Page & More!"
- [ ] Test titles with quotes: 'My "Special" Page'
- [ ] **Expected**: Should handle all characters correctly

### Very Long Titles
- [ ] Test with very long title (200+ characters)
- [ ] **Expected**: Should handle gracefully

### Whitespace Handling
- [ ] Test title with leading/trailing spaces: "  My Page  "
- [ ] Test title with only spaces: "    "
- [ ] **Expected**: Should trim whitespace and handle empty titles

### Case Sensitivity
- [ ] Create page with title "Test Page"
- [ ] Try to create another with "test page" or "TEST PAGE"
- [ ] **Expected**: Should detect as duplicate (case-insensitive)

## Cleanup

- [ ] Delete any test pages created during testing
- [ ] Clear browser cache if needed
- [ ] Document any issues found during testing

## Issues to Report

For each issue found, document:
- [ ] Steps to reproduce
- [ ] Expected behavior
- [ ] Actual behavior
- [ ] Browser and version
- [ ] Console errors (if any)
- [ ] Network requests (if relevant)
