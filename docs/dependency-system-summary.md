- Automated patch-level dependency updates
- Security vulnerability scanning

### Self-Healing Capabilities
- Automatic missing dependency installation
- Import path standardization
- Unused dependency removal
- Broken import path fixing
- Comprehensive error recovery

## üìà Key Improvements

### Before Implementation
- Manual dependency management
- No systematic import validation
- Inconsistent import path conventions
