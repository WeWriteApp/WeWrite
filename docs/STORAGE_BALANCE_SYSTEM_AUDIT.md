## üí∞ **WeWrite Revenue Breakdown**

### **Revenue Sources:**
1. **Platform Fees (7%)** - From allocated funds
2. **Unallocated Funds (100%)** - "Use it or lose it"

### **Example Month:**
```
Total Subscriptions: $1,000
User Allocations: $700 (70% allocation rate)
Unallocated: $300 (30% unallocated)

WeWrite Revenue:
- Platform fees: $700 √ó 7% = $49
- Unallocated funds: $300 √ó 100% = $300
- Total WeWrite revenue: $349 (34.9%)

Creator Payouts:
- Net to creators: $700 - $49 = $651 (65.1%)
```
