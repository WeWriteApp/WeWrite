# Recent Activity Deduplication Implementation

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive deduplication logic for the Recent Activity section on the home page to ensure variety and prevent any single page from dominating the feed.

## Problem Solved
Previously, if a user made multiple rapid edits to the same page, the entire Recent Activity section could be filled with activities from that single page, reducing the diversity of content shown to users.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Deduplication Logic
**Location**: Both server-side (`app/api/activity/route.js`) and client-side (`app/hooks/useRecentActivity.js`)

**Algorithm**:
1. **Group by Page ID**: Activities are grouped by their `pageId`
2. **Keep Most Recent**: For each page, only the most recent activity (highest timestamp) is retained
3. **Sort by Timestamp**: Final results are sorted by timestamp (most recent first)
4. **Apply Limit**: Results are limited to the requested count

### 2. Deduplication Function
```javascript
function deduplicateActivitiesByPage(activities) {
  if (!activities || activities.length === 0) {
    return [];
  }

  // Group activities by pageId
  const pageActivityMap = new Map();

  activities.forEach(activity => {
    if (!activity || !activity.pageId) {
      return; // Skip invalid activities
    }

    const pageId = activity.pageId;
    const activityTimestamp = activity.timestamp ? new Date(activity.timestamp).getTime() : 0;

    // Check if we already have an activity for this page
    if (pageActivityMap.has(pageId)) {
      const existingActivity = pageActivityMap.get(pageId);
      const existingTimestamp = existingActivity.timestamp ? new Date(existingActivity.timestamp).getTime() : 0;

      // Keep the more recent activity
      if (activityTimestamp > existingTimestamp) {
        pageActivityMap.set(pageId, activity);
      }
    } else {
      // First activity for this page
      pageActivityMap.set(pageId, activity);
    }
  });

  // Convert map values back to array
  return Array.from(pageActivityMap.values());
}
```

### 3. Performance Optimizations

#### Server-Side (API Route)
- **Increased Fetch Limit**: Fetch 3x more pages than needed to account for deduplication
- **Efficient Processing**: Deduplication happens after filtering but before final sorting
- **Logging**: Added comprehensive logging to track deduplication effectiveness

#### Client-Side (React Hook)
- **Increased Fetch Limit**: Fetch 3x more pages (`Math.max(limitRef.current * 3, 50)`)
- **Memory Efficient**: Uses Map for O(1) lookups during deduplication
- **Consistent Logic**: Same deduplication algorithm as server-side

### 4. Activity Types Covered
The deduplication applies to all activity types currently in the system:
- **Page Edits**: Multiple edits to the same page show only the most recent
- **Page Creation**: New page activities are preserved
- **Content Changes**: Only the latest content change per page is shown

### 5. Metadata Preservation
The deduplication process preserves all original metadata:
- **Author Information**: Username, user ID, tier, subscription status
- **Timestamps**: Original creation/modification timestamps
- **Activity Type**: Whether it's a new page or edit
- **Content**: Both current and previous content for diff generation
- **Visibility**: Public/private status

## Implementation Files Modified

### Server-Side
- **`app/api/activity/route.js`**
  - Added `deduplicateActivitiesByPage()` function
  - Updated processing pipeline to include deduplication
  - Increased fetch limit from `limitCount * 2` to `Math.max(limitCount * 3, 50)`
  - Enhanced logging for debugging

### Client-Side
- **`app/hooks/useRecentActivity.js`** (Unified Hook)
  - Added `deduplicateActivitiesByPage()` function
  - Updated activity processing pipeline
  - Increased fetch limits in all query scenarios
  - Added deduplication step before final sorting and limiting
  - Consolidated all recent activity functionality into single hook

## Benefits

### 1. **Improved User Experience**
- Users see a diverse range of recent activities across different pages
- No single page can dominate the entire feed
- Better discovery of content from various authors

### 2. **Maintained Performance**
- Efficient O(n) deduplication algorithm
- Minimal memory overhead using Map data structure
- Preserved existing caching and optimization strategies

### 3. **Preserved Functionality**
- All existing filtering options still work (mine only, followed only, etc.)
- Activity metadata and content diffs are fully preserved
- Sorting and pagination remain unchanged

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. **Rapid Edits Test**
- User makes 10 rapid edits to the same page
- Expected: Only 1 activity (most recent) appears in feed
- Other pages' activities remain visible

### 2. **Mixed Activity Test**
- Multiple users edit different pages
- Expected: Each page shows only its most recent activity
- Activities from all pages are represented

### 3. **New Page Creation Test**
- User creates new pages and edits existing ones
- Expected: New page activities are preserved
- Edit activities are deduplicated per page

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Server-Side Logging
```
API: Fetching 150 pages for deduplication (target: 50 activities)
API: Deduplication - Input: 120 activities, Output: 45 unique pages
API: Returning 45 activities after deduplication and sorting
API: Activity variety - 45 unique pages in 45 activities
```

### Client-Side Logging
```
Client: Deduplication - Input: 85 activities, Output: 42 unique pages
```

## Future Enhancements

### 1. **Configurable Deduplication**
- Add user preference to enable/disable deduplication
- Allow different deduplication strategies (time-based, content-based)

### 2. **Advanced Grouping**
- Group by author + page for even more variety
- Consider activity type in deduplication logic

### 3. **Performance Monitoring**
- Track deduplication effectiveness metrics
- Monitor impact on page load times
- Optimize fetch limits based on actual deduplication ratios

## Conclusion
The deduplication implementation successfully ensures variety in the Recent Activity feed while maintaining all existing functionality and performance characteristics. Users now see a more diverse and engaging activity feed that showcases content from multiple pages and authors.
