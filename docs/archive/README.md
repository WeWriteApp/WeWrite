## üîÑ What Replaced These Documents

### Current Active Documentation
The archived documents have been consolidated into these current guides:

#### Architecture & System Design
- `CURRENT_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Replaces multiple architecture documents
- `PAYMENT_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md` - Replaces multiple payment system docs

#### Performance & Optimization
- `PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md` - Consolidates all optimization summaries
- `FIREBASE_COST_OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md` - Current optimization status

#### Migration Status
- `USD_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Current USD system status (migration complete)

## üìö When to Reference Archive

### Historical Context
- Understanding how current systems evolved
- Debugging issues related to past migrations
- Learning from past optimization strategies

### Audit Requirements
- Compliance audits requiring historical documentation
- Change management documentation
- System evolution tracking

### Troubleshooting
- Issues that might be related to past migrations
- Understanding why certain architectural decisions were made
- Reference for rollback procedures (if needed)

## üö® Important Notes

### Archive Maintenance
- **Do not modify** archived documents - they are historical records
- **Do not reference** archived documents in active code or documentation
- **Update current documentation** instead of un-archiving old documents

### Migration Status
All migrations documented in this archive are **COMPLETED** and should not be re-run:
- ‚úÖ Token to USD migration (2024)
- ‚úÖ Storage Balance migration (2025)
- ‚úÖ Content Display refactoring (2025)
- ‚úÖ Architecture simplification (2024-2025)
- ‚úÖ Firebase cost optimization (2025)

### Current System Status
The current WeWrite system uses:
- **USD-based payments** (no tokens)
- **Simplified architecture** (no complex provider chains)
- **Optimized database queries** (90% cost reduction achieved)
- **Separated financial contexts** (performance optimized)

## üìû Support

If you need information from archived documents:
1. **First check current documentation** - most information has been consolidated
2. **Search the archive** for specific historical context
3. **Contact the development team** if you need clarification on archived content
