# WeWrite Storage Balance System - Complete System Summary

## üéØ **System Overview**

WeWrite's revolutionary payout system uses **Stripe's Storage Balance** for perfect fund separation combined with the innovative **"Use It or Lose It"** model. Subscription funds are intelligently separated: creator obligations go to Storage Balance (escrowed), while platform revenue stays in Payments Balance.

## üöÄ **Key Innovation: "Use It or Lose It"**

The core innovation is the **"Use It or Lose It"** system:
- Users must actively allocate their subscription funds each month
- Unallocated funds automatically become platform revenue at month-end
- This encourages user engagement and creates sustainable platform revenue

## üìä **How It Works**

### **Monthly Cycle**
1. **Days 1-31**: Users allocate subscription funds to creators
2. **Month-End**: Allocations lock, earnings calculated
3. **1st of Next Month**: Eligible creators receive payouts
4. **Platform Revenue**: Unallocated funds transferred to business account

### **Fund Flow**
```
Subscription Payment ‚Üí Payments Balance ‚Üí User Allocates ‚Üí Storage Balance (creator obligations)
                                      ‚Üí Unallocated ‚Üí Payments Balance (platform revenue)
Month-End: Storage Balance ‚Üí Creator Payouts
```
